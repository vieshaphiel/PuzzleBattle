球兔拼圖對戰 / Ballrabbit Puzzle Battle
by Kinra

表面上的遊戲規則 / How To Play
- 雙方輪流在盤面上放拼圖塊，放不進去的就輸了
  Players take turns to place pieces onto the board;
  the one who's unable to place a piece loses
- 每次放拼圖塊都可以集氣，耗半條氣可以放炸彈清掉隨機格子
  Every placement fills the player's energy gauge;
  spend half the gauge to bomb random tiles clear

真正的遊戲規則 / What the Game Is Actually Played For
- 雙方合計每放 10 個拼圖塊，背景會多一隻球兔過來圍觀
  For every 10 pieces the players have placed,
  one curious ballrabbit will join the background crowd
- 你和對手能讓這場對決吸引到多少圍觀球兔！？
  How many curious ballrabbits can you and your opponent
  attract with your exciting battle?!
